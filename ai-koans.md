# The AI Koans

## Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine

A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the
power off and on.

Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: “You
cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding
of what is going wrong.”

Knight turned the machine off and on.

The machine worked.

## Moon Instructs a Student

One day a student came to Moon and said: “I understand how to make
a better garbage collector. We must keep a reference count of the
pointers to each cons.”

Moon patiently told the student the following story:

“One day a student came to Moon and said: ‘I understand how to make
a better garbage collector...

## Sussman Attains Enlightenment

In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as
he sat hacking at the PDP-6.

“What are you doing?” asked Minsky.

“I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe,”
Sussman replied.

“Why is the net wired randomly?” asked Minsky.

“I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play”, Sussman said.

Minsky then shut his eyes.

“Why do you close your eyes?” Sussman asked his teacher.

“So that the room will be empty.”

At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.

## Drescher and the Toaster

A disciple of another sect once came to Drescher as he was eating
his morning meal.

“I would like to give you this personality test”, said the outsider,
“because I want you to be happy.”

Drescher took the paper that was offered him and put it into the
toaster, saying: “I wish the toaster to be happy, too.”

## Stallman and the Novice

A cocky novice once said to Stallman: “I can guess why the editor
is called Emacs, but why is the justifier called Bolio?”

Stallman replied forcefully, “Names are but names.  ‘Emack & Bolio’s’
is the name of a confectionary shop in Boston-town. Neither of these
men had anything to do with the software.”

His question answered, yet unanswered, the novice turned to go, but
Stallman called to him, “Neither Emack nor Bolio had anything to do
with the ice cream shop, either.”

This is known as the ice-cream koan.

## Sarah and Jain

Sarah's program kept crashing.

The teacher Jain came by.

Sarah said, “The program! Its recursion is overflowing. Can you
help?”

Without hesitation Jain told Sarah to wear a tail.

Sarah scoffed at this, so Jain wore the tail of a fox. The program
stopped crashing.
